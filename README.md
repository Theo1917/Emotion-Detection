# Emotion-Detection
This project demonstrates the use of a multi-modal approach for emotion detection, leveraging both visual and audio cues to predict emotions. The system combines computer vision and audio processing techniques to analyze facial expressions and voice patterns, offering a more robust solution compared to unimodal emotion detection systems.
Key Features:
Facial Expression Recognition: Using deep learning models to detect emotions from facial expressions.
Speech Emotion Recognition: Analyzing audio features such as pitch, tone, and speech rate to assess emotional state.
Integration of Multi-Modal Data: Combining visual and audio data to improve emotion detection accuracy.
Real-Time Emotion Detection: Capable of predicting emotions in real-time for live input.
Technologies Used:
Python
OpenCV, Dlib (for facial detection)
librosa (for audio feature extraction)
TensorFlow/Keras (for machine learning models)
This project aims to build a more accurate and reliable emotion detection system that could be applied to areas like human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and security.
