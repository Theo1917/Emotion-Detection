# Emotion-Detection
This project demonstrates the use of a multi-modal approach for emotion detection, leveraging both visual and audio cues to predict emotions. The system combines computer vision and audio processing techniques to analyze facial expressions and voice patterns, offering a more robust solution compared to unimodal emotion detection systems.
